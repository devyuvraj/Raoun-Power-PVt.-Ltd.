                    In our homes, we rely on electricity to power our lights, appliances, and electronics. Many of us also use electricity to provide our homes with hot water, heat, and air conditioning. As we use more electricity in our homes, our electric bills rise.
                    Explore the following topics to reduce your electricity use, purchase efficient products, save money on your electric bills, and buy or make clean electricity:

            <h2 class="h1-responsive text-info">Lighting Choices to Save You Money</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    You can take advantage of clean, renewable energy by buying "green power" or by making your own electricity with a small home renewable energy system. Learn the purchasing options available in your area, or learn how to plan your own system and choose the right technology for your location and electricity needs.

            <h2 class="h1-responsive text-info">Buying and Making Electricity</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    You have many choices in energy-efficient lighting. The most popular light bulbs available are halogen incandescents, compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Although they can initially cost more than traditional incandescent bulbs, during their lifetime they save you money, because they use less energy. You can find these in most hardware and home improvement stores.
                    Controls such as timers and photocells save electricity by turning lights off when not in use. Dimmers save electricity when used to lower light levels. Be sure to select products that are compatible with the energy-efficient bulbs you want to use.
                    If you have outdoor lighting that is left on for a long time, using CFLs or LEDs in these fixtures will save a lot of energy. Most bare spiral CFLs can be used in enclosed fixtures that protect them from the weather. CFLs and LEDs are available as flood lights. These models have been tested to withstand the rain and snow so they can be used in exposed fixtures. Also look for ENERGY STAR-qualified fixtures that are designed for outdoor use and come with features like automatic daylight shut-off and motion sensors.
